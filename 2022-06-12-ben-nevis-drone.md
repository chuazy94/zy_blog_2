title: A Jubilee escape from London

Its been nearly one year and I am making a return. This time not so much about football analytics...

Jubilee weekend 2022 was spent summiting Ben Nevis. I brought along my trusty DJI Mini SE and captured some amazing shots en route to the top. Here's the video montage of the flight over Fort William and Ben Nevis! Enjoy!
